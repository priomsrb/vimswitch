This directory is used as a temporary working area for tests that work on
files.

Everything in this directory gets deleted before and after a test run.
Including this file. But we still add this file to git because git refuses to
add empty folders. So if you notice that this file is deleted in git, don't
commit the deletion. Just ignore that this file was deleted.
